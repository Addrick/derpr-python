    `_orchestrate(continuation=...)` runs an ordinary turn that happens to log
    no user row: history is rebuilt LIVE from the DB (where each resolved
    write's entry has already been patched with its real outcome), so the model
    reads what actually happened and summarizes it.

    This replaced DP-124's `_ResumeState`, which instead replayed the parked
    turn's *snapshot* of history. A snapshot cannot survive DP-297's bursts —
    with several parks resolvable in any order, every snapshot predates its
    siblings, so replaying one forks the conversation.

    Exists for a wire-level reason, not a prompt-engineering one: without it the
    message array would end on the parked turn's assistant message, which
    Anthropic treats as a prefill to continue rather than a turn to answer — the
    model would resume its old sentence instead of reporting the outcome.

    Deliberately NOT persisted. `prepare_request` appends it to the in-memory
    history only; the continuation skips `log_user_turn`, so the durable record
    of what happened stays the patched tool entries rather than words the
    operator never typed.

    That non-persistence is the property both re-derived wake paths lost. fixr
    and DP-343 entered through `generate_response`, where `continuation is None`
    and `_orchestrate` therefore calls `log_user_turn` — so their whole
    synthetic wake text, instruction block included, was written to durable
    history as a **user row**, under the operator's real Discord id for DP-343.
    Every later turn in that channel then re-read "Nobody asked you this…" as

    persist it is not, and that is why there is one of these.

        The twin of `stream_resolve_park` for the kinds whose answer comes from
        an authority rather than a human: a node job finishing, an agent
        emitting `done`. Everything after the claim is literally the same code —
        see `_stream_settle` — because folding, patching and continuing were
        never approval-specific, and rebuilding them per subsystem is what this
        ticket exists to undo.

        Addressed by TOKEN, like every other kind. The authority is not handed
        some identifier of its own that we then have to map back: derpr mints
        the park token and passes that same string outward as the job id, so
        the thing the node names in its callback IS the park. A second

        `kind` is what the CALLER EXPECTS to be answering, not a lookup key —
        the claim is `take(token)` and the kind is checked against the row

        the wrong mechanism is the failure this whole ticket is about:

          and `result` describe some other piece of work.

        Both restore the park rather than dropping it, exactly as the persona
        check below does.

        `status` and `result` are the *re-read* outcome, per DP-343's rule that
