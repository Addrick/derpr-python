"""Token-keyed store + lifecycle for writes gated on human approval.

DP-200 slice B extracted this from ChatSystem; DP-297 made it *non-blocking*.
A parked write no longer ends the turn, so one turn can queue several, each
with its own token, each resolvable independently and out of order.

Division of labour: this module owns the pending set, execution of an approved
call, the in-place patch of the parked history entry, expiry, and the audit
trail. The orchestrator (`ChatSystem`) owns the continuation turn that runs
afterwards, because that needs the whole turn lifecycle.

          re-executed: the write may or may not have run, and re-running an

        Shared by the lazy sweep, the boot reload and the resolve path. The
        click path used to inline the patch with a hardcoded "expired" and log
        nothing, which made it the only park-terminating path leaving no audit
        trail — so the fact that a human actually tried to approve an expired
        irreversible action was recorded nowhere, and its writer was decoupled
        from the constant every other consumer keys off.

        `resolution` is the filterable outcome, `reason` the sentence that says
        which of the three ways it got here. Passing the sentence as the
        resolution — the original shape — made every future query over expired
        rows match nothing.
