# src/memory/context_budget.py
"""Token-budget enforcement shared between chat_system and the kobold engine adapter.

`max_context_tokens` is a persona setting that caps the *total* context
(prompt + reserved response), matching KoboldCPP's `max_context_length`
semantic. Effective prompt-prune budget
is therefore `max_context_tokens - response_token_limit`.

Today this module only does char/4 estimation + drop-oldest pruning;
future work documented in `memory/project/plans/web_ui_roadmap.md`
(dynamic LTM-depth modulation, real tokenizer swap, retrieval-score-weighted
budget allocation) lands here.

    """Drop a tool sequence left dangling at the head of `messages`.

    A tool turn is three messages long — `user`, `assistant` (with
    `tool_calls`), `tool` (the result) — while the windows that trim history
    count *messages*, not turns, so a cut can land mid-sequence and leave the
    history *starting* on an `assistant`-with-`tool_calls` or a `tool` message
    whose triggering user turn is gone.

    Two of the three producers of that shape are now fixed upstream, and this
    is the backstop rather than the primary defense for them:

    * `truncate_messages_to_budget` above treats an `assistant`+`tool_calls`
      message and its `tool` answers as one atomic span (DP-296), so the token
      pruner no longer splits a pair;
    * `build_conversation_history` refuses to replay an assistant row's
      `tool_context` unless a `user` or `tool` turn precedes it (DP-296), which
      closes the DB sliding-window case at the source.

    The path where this function is still load-bearing is `client_messages`
    (a non-streaming OAI client supplies its own array, which `prepare_request` takes verbatim
    apart from stripping one leading system message) — neither guard above runs
    on it. Keeping the repair as the last stop before the wire also means any
    future producer of an unpaired head fails safe.

    Providers reject that shape: Google returns 400 "function call turn must
    come immediately after a user turn" for a leading `function_call`, and
    "function response turn must come immediately after a function call turn"
    for a leading bare result. Since the orphan's context is already gone, the
    repair is to drop it — no valid prompt can be built from a half turn.

    Two kinds of message may sit *in front* of the orphan without making it
    well-formed, and must be scanned through rather than treated as the head:

    * `role == "system"` entries, which `truncate_messages_to_budget`
      deliberately preserves while dropping the conversation around them, and
      of which the `client_messages` path strips only one;
    * anything in `injected` — head content the request builder prepends after
      truncation (the long-term-memory recall block, a `user` message that is
      not a real conversational turn). Matched by **identity**, so a caller can
      pass a block that may or may not have survived pruning and get the right
      answer either way.

    Neither is a turn the orphan can legally attach to, so skipping them and
    continuing the scan is what makes the repair fire in the cases that
    actually reach a provider.

    Returns `(repaired_messages, dropped_count)`. The skipped preamble is
    preserved in the result; only the orphaned tool messages are removed.
