"""Async SSH runner for the Proxmox tools (DP-262).

A thin wrapper over ``ssh -i <key> <user>@<host> <argv...>``. It runs the remote
command as an *argv list* (not a shell string) so callers never build shell
strings from model-supplied values — every argument is passed positionally to
``ssh``, which forwards them to the remote command without a second local shell.

The remote side still runs under the login shell, so we additionally reject any
argument containing shell metacharacters as defense in depth: the only values
that ever reach here are numeric vmids and config-pinned unit names, so a
metacharacter means misuse, not a legitimate call.

``run_node_command`` is the **single gate** in front of the node, and every tool
that reaches the box goes through it — not just the proxmox ones. It owns the two
things that are properties of *the key and the box's sshd* rather than of any one
handler: the ``PVE_TOOLS_ENABLED`` transport switch and the in-flight cap.
DP-348: they used to live inside ``ProxmoxToolHandler._run``, so when the
HuggingFace tools grew their own copy of that method they inherited neither.
