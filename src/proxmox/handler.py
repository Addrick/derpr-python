"""Tool handlers for the Proxmox management service (DP-262).

Eight tools behind the ``proxmox`` service binding:

- ``pve_status``      (read):  node uptime + `pct list` + `qm list`, both raw and
  parsed into a structured guest inventory (DP-327).
- ``list_models``     (read):  koboldcpp units discovered on the GPU CT + which
  one is active (DP-332).
- ``gpu_status``      (read):  live VRAM total/used/free per card, straight from
  the GPU CT's sysfs (DP-332).
- ``reboot_node``     (WRITE, irreversible → parked): reboot the metal.
- ``reboot_guest``    (WRITE → parked): reboot one VM/CT.
- ``start_guest``     (WRITE → parked): start one VM/CT.
- ``stop_guest``      (WRITE → parked): stop one VM/CT.
- ``set_active_model``(WRITE → parked): swap the enabled koboldcpp unit on :5001.

Every handler returns a JSON-able dict. Transport failures and disabled state are
returned as ``{"status": "error", ...}`` rather than raised, so the model gets a
clean message instead of a tool crash.

DP-327 — guests are addressable by ``name`` as well as ``vmid``. The lookup is
deliberately **local**: the inventory comes from parsing `pct list` / `qm list`
output, the name is matched here, and only the resolved digits are ever handed to
``SSHRunner``. A model-supplied hostname therefore never crosses the SSH boundary,
which keeps ``ssh.py``'s metacharacter guard seeing nothing but integers and
unit names matching ``_UNIT_RE`` — the property the whole transport's safety
argument rests on.

DP-332 — the koboldcpp units are **discovered**, not configured. The box is the
authority on what it contains; the old ``PVE_MODEL_UNITS`` map asserted it and
drifted silently in both directions (DP-329: the unit actually holding :5001 was
unmapped, so ``list_models`` reported every model inactive and no swap could
succeed). Discovery costs two properties the map gave for free:

1. The unit names are now *remote* values that get sent back over SSH, which is
   why every discovered name must match ``_UNIT_RE`` before it is used as an
   argv element. (A discovered ``--model`` path is a remote value too, and is
   not pattern-checked — ``ssh.py``'s metacharacter guard is what stands behind
   that one.)
2. The set is no longer curated, so "every koboldcpp unit on the box" is not the
   same set as "every unit competing for :5001". ``set_active_model`` disables
   by parsed ``--port``, not by name — see ``_port_contenders``.
