"""Tool handlers for HuggingFace model provisioning (DP-265).

Four tools behind the ``huggingface`` service binding:

- ``hf_search``      (read, HF):    gguf repos matching a query.
- ``hf_files``       (read, HF):    one repo's gguf files with byte size + sha256.
- ``install_model``  (WRITE → parked): download a gguf onto the pve node and
  template a **disabled** ``koboldcpp-<name>.service`` for it.
- ``install_status`` (read, node):  poll one install job.

Every handler returns a JSON-able dict; transport, validation and Hub failures
come back as ``{"status": "error", ...}`` rather than raised, so the model gets a
message instead of a tool crash.

**The security boundary is the node-side script, not this module.** Everything
here runs one command — ``/usr/local/sbin/derpr-model-install`` — over the same
forced-command-wrapped SSH key the proxmox tools use. The alternative, letting
the model drive ``curl`` / ``systemctl`` / file writes as separate verbs, would
widen that key to arbitrary node write for the sake of a slightly simpler
handler. One verb keeps it lean *and* narrow; see ``services/pve/README.md``.

**The download does not happen inside the tool loop.** A multi-GB fetch exceeds
any sane tool timeout, so the node runs it detached under ``systemd-run`` and
derpr polls ``install_status``. Deliberately *not* a background task inside
derpr: that re-opens the DP-304 interval-loop shutdown-contract problem for a
job the node is already supervising.

Two things the model never gets to decide:

1. **What bytes land.** ``install_model`` reads the file's size and sha256 from
   the Hub itself and passes them to the node, which refuses on any mismatch.
   The same two values are what the enricher puts on the approval card, so the
   human approves a *digest*, not a repo name.
2. **Where they land.** The node script owns the models directory and the unit
   template; nothing in the arguments is a path.

    the model's block count — the node reads it off the tensor index precisely
    because the two differ on every hybrid architecture this host serves.
