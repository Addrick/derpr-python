        the newest one, and nothing has to still be awaiting it.

        RAW, not `on_reaction_add`. discord.py dispatches the non-raw event only
        for messages still in the client's in-memory message cache — a deque of
        `max_messages` (1000 by default) filled by MESSAGE_CREATE while
        connected, and empty after a restart. So the cooked handler could not
        fire for a proposal posted before the restart, which since DP-319 is the
        exact case the stale-button notice exists for, and it silently stopped
        resolving *live* 24h parks on a busy guild once their message aged out
        of the deque. Durable parks outlive the cache, so the handler has to as
        well. The `reactions` intent this needs is already in `Intents.default`.
