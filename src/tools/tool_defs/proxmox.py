"""Proxmox management tools (service_binding: proxmox, DP-262).

Node/guest power ops + koboldcpp model swap on :5001, executed over SSH to the
pve node. Destructive tools are ``is_write: True`` so the ConfirmationManager
parks them for human approval regardless of persona execution mode;
``reboot_node`` is additionally ``irreversible``. Read tools (`pve_status`,
`list_models`, `gpu_status`) are ungated.

All results originate from infra we control (not attacker text) →
``produces_untrusted: False``; ``locality: "network"`` (SSH to the node);
``sensitivity: "internal"``.

⚠️ **Every WRITE tool here is ``exfil_capable: False`` (DP-265).** Read the
reasoning before adding one that is not. The claim these tools make is narrow and
true: their arguments are vmids, guest names and model keys **discovered from the
node itself**, and in every case the value that crosses SSH is the *resolved* one —
``_resolve_guest`` matches a name locally and sends digits, ``set_active_model``
sends the discovered unit rather than the caller's string. So no model-authored
payload rides out over the SSH, and these are not data-exfil vectors. Destructive
risk is unaffected: it is covered by ``is_write`` (parked for confirmation).

The flag became load-bearing when DP-265 put untrusted HuggingFace reads on the
same persona. Without it, ``ToolPolicy`` Rule 2 sees untrusted reads in the
``huggingface`` domain beside network writes in the ``proxmox`` domain, calls
that a foreign-domain write, and quarantines ``hypr``. The alternative fix — an
``explicit_overrides`` entry — would disarm Rule 2 for that persona's whole
toolset permanently, including for tools nobody has written yet. A future proxmox
tool that genuinely does carry a model-authored string out to the node must NOT
copy this flag; it must leave the default ``True`` and the composition must be
re-reasoned.

``pve_status`` and ``list_models`` keep the default ``True`` on purpose even
though they take no arguments either: that is what sets ``has_network_read``, and
Rule 1 (network read + local write) is the protection that should fire if a local
write tool is ever added to this persona.
