"""HuggingFace model-provisioning tools (service_binding: huggingface, DP-265).

Two Hub reads, one parked write that provisions a gguf onto the pve node, and
one poll for the resulting job.

**Read this before changing a capability flag here.** The four tools sit beside
the proxmox toolset on one persona (``hypr``), and that composition is the whole
reason the flags are what they are:

- ``hf_search`` / ``hf_files`` are ``produces_untrusted: True``. Repo ids,
  filenames and card text are written by whoever uploaded the repo.
- Their egress domain is ``huggingface``, straight from ``service_binding``.
- ``install_model`` writes to the same domain it reads from: derpr's own hop is
  SSH to the node, but the payload it carries — the repo id — is what the node
  then fetches *from HuggingFace*. Tagging it ``huggingface`` is therefore
  accurate, not a dodge, and it makes the persona a **same-origin closed loop**
  under ``ToolPolicy`` Rule 2 rather than an exfiltration path.
- ``install_status`` declares ``domain: "proxmox"`` explicitly (the
  ``capabilities["domain"]`` seam), because its egress genuinely is the node and
  not the Hub. It is ``exfil_capable: False``: the only argument is a job id
  matched against ``_JOB_ID_RE`` **before** it crosses SSH, bound for a host we
  own.

The counterpart edit lives in ``proxmox.py``: the guest/node write tools became
``exfil_capable: False`` in the same change. Without that, ``network_write_domains``
would still hold ``proxmox`` while the untrusted reads are ``huggingface``, Rule
2 would fire on a foreign-domain write, and ``hypr`` would be quarantined. The
honest fix is the flag on those tools (their arguments are vmids and names
*discovered from the node*, so no model-authored payload rides out) — **not** an
``explicit_overrides`` entry, which would disarm Rule 2 for hypr's whole toolset
permanently, including for tools added later.
