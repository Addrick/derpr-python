# src/tools/tool_loop.py
"""Stream-shaped tool loop.

Owns a single iteration: drive `text_engine.stream_messages`, forward
token deltas, surface tool calls as `ToolCallStartEvent` /
`ToolCallResultEvent`, append results to history, repeat until the model
stops calling tools or `max_iterations` trips.

The loop trusts the tools list it's handed — capability filtering /
policy decisions live in the caller (currently `ChatSystem`, eventually
the security framework in the sibling plan).
