        """DP-330: coerce an authored or CLI-supplied allowlist into
        ``(authored_entries, parsed_entries, malformed, rejected_entries)``.

        ``authored`` keeps every entry that stringified, **including ones that
        were then rejected** — it is what gets written back to disk, and
        silently dropping the operator's typo from the file would hide the
        thing they have to fix. ``rejected`` is therefore not derivable from
        ``authored``, and reporting needs it: "12345, \\*" are the authored
        entries but only "12345" is in force.

        The declared type is ``List[str]``, but this value comes straight out
        of a hand-edited JSON file, so nothing about it can be trusted:

        - **Ints are accepted.** A Discord guild id is a number and the
          natural way to write one in JSON is unquoted. Rejecting it is not an
          option — the raw value used to reach ``','.join`` and raise
          ``TypeError``, which ``load_personas_from_file`` swallowed into a
          ``None`` return, which dropped *every* user persona and let the next
          mutating dev command rewrite ``personas.json`` with an empty list.
        - **A bare string is one authored value, not five characters.**
          ``"12345"`` splits on whitespace/commas the way the CLI setter
          does, never into ``list("12345")``.
        - **Entries are parsed one at a time.** Joining them with ``','``
          first meant a comma *inside* an entry silently added a guild that
          was never authored — a typo that widens reachability, the exact
          opposite of the fail-closed property this field is supposed to have.

        Fail-closed on malformed input: if *anything* was supplied but none of
        it parses, the persona becomes unreachable rather than unrestricted.
        An empty allowlist means "no restriction", so leaving a typo'd list to
        parse down to empty would turn a restriction into a wide-open persona
        while ``what origin_allowlist`` kept reporting the authored entries as
        if they were in force. Unreachable is loud, recoverable by editing the
        file, and confined to this one persona.

        **The trigger is "an entry was supplied", not "an entry survived
        stringification".** Keying it off ``authored`` inverted the guarantee
        for the two shapes that never reach that list: a wholly-unstringifiable
        list (``[None]``, ``[True]``, ``[["12345"]]``) and a blank-only one
        (``["", "   "]``) both left ``authored`` empty, so the fail-closed
        branch never fired and the persona came out **unrestricted** — the
        widening this whole function exists to prevent, on input it had already
        diagnosed as bad. Blank entries are rejections, not nothing: an entry
        the operator typed and this function cannot use is exactly what
        ``rejected`` means.
