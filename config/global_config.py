# Tool budget for one turn. Counts TOOL CALLS EXECUTED, not LLM round trips.
#
# DP-335 moved the counter. It used to bound loop iterations, which meant the
# number bought a different amount of work on every model: a model answering
# one call per message got 10 calls from 10 iterations; a model that batches
# five per message got 50 from the same config value, with no compensation
# anywhere. The budget could not be tuned because it did not denote a fixed
# quantity. Counting calls makes the allowance provider-independent and makes
# batching a pure latency win instead of a silent 5x budget multiplier.
#
# ⚠️ DP-335 wrote here that live `hypr` (agy-flash) "emits exactly one call per
# message". DP-338 falsified that: agy-flash emits as many blocks as the
# persona asks for, and the agy PARSER was keeping only the first — so the
# observed one-call-per-message was derpr's ceiling, not the model's habit.
# The number below still stands (it was never sized on that premise), but do
# not re-derive anything from "hypr can only call one tool at a time".
#
# Sized against hypr's model-provisioning floor, which is the longest routine
# any persona runs: pve_status + gpu_status + list_models + hf_search +
# hf_files + install_model = 6 calls with zero missteps. 15 clears that with
# room for two dead ends (a search that returns nothing useful plus the file
# read that follows it costs ~2 calls each) and still ends the turn.
#
# ⚠️ This does NOT bound how many proposals a turn can emit, and a batch is
# never split to fit. One model response may carry any number of calls; they
# all run, even if the batch crosses the budget, and the turn ends after it.
# That is deliberate — six ticket updates proposed together are one considered
# plan, not runaway behaviour, and truncating a batch would execute half of a
# coherent group for an arbitrary number's sake.
#
# What IS bounded is repetition: `tool_loop.write_call_identity` refuses to park
# a proposal identical to one already awaiting the operator, so a model that
# ignores the "do not re-submit" instruction cannot turn N iterations into N
# copies of the same affordance.
MAX_TOOL_CALLS = 15

# Pure runaway guard: max LLM round trips in one turn, independent of how many
# calls they carry. Separate from MAX_TOOL_CALLS because the two answer
# different questions — that one is "how much work may this turn do", this one
# is "how many times may we talk to the provider before declaring the loop
# stuck".
#
# ⚠️ It is UNREACHABLE at these defaults, and that is the intended state. Every
# iteration that continues past the tool-call check charges at least one call,
# so `iterations_used <= calls_used` always holds and the call budget is always
# the limit that trips first while MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS > MAX_TOOL_CALLS. This
# is a backstop against a future loop shape that can iterate without spending,
# not a live limit. (The original justification here — "a model that emits an
# empty tool-call list forever reaches this one" — was simply wrong: an empty
# tool-call list is the loop's natural-exit branch and ends the turn at once.)
#
# `tests/tools/test_tool_loop.py` pins the ordering invariant, because the day
# MAX_TOOL_CALLS rises past this number the guard silently starts truncating
# ordinary turns.

#
# DP-319 made the store durable (`Parked_Writes`), so this is now the whole

# window: a terminal row is the only place that records an irreversible write
# was proposed, who decided it, and how it came out, in a form you can query
# after the fact — a week is how long "what did the bot do to my ticket
# queue on Tuesday" stays answerable. Sizing it off the guard instead would be
# resizing the wrong knob.

# load, far too often for a DELETE. This throttles it to something matched to
# a 7-day retention. It ran only at boot before DP-319 review, which meant a
# long-lived process never enforced retention at all.
PARK_PURGE_INTERVAL = 60 * 60

# How long after an APPROVED write actually ran an identical re-proposal is
# answered with its outcome instead of being parked again.
#
# Deliberately short, and deliberately not PENDING_ACTION_TTL. The case being
# closed is narrow: during the continuation turn the model re-reads its own tool
# span and re-proposes the write it just got approved, and approving the second
# park would execute an irreversible action twice. That window is seconds.
#
# Making it a day instead would break a legitimate case DP-297 explicitly
# supports — the operator asking for the same action again on purpose. The
# guard is confined to continuation turns for the same reason: on an ordinary
# turn a repeat request is a request, and suppressing it would answer the
# operator with "that already happened" and no affordance to force it through.
#
# `approved_but_failed` counts as ran (the tool raised *after* it may have had

# --- DP-227: fixr base clone + per-dispatch worktrees -------------------------
# The "fixr" supervisor dispatches one detached coding agent per bug. Each agent
# runs in an isolated `git worktree` off a PRISTINE base clone of derpr's OWN
# repo (only ever `git fetch`ed, never reset/cleaned while worktrees attached),
# so parallel dispatches can't corrupt each other. The dispatch tool
# (src/self_edit/clone_manager.py) creates the worktree and points the cc-*
# engine workspace at it; engine.py stays transport-only.
#
# CC_FIXR_CLONE_DIR  — absolute path of the persistent BASE clone. Worktrees
#                      live under <CC_FIXR_CLONE_DIR>/worktrees/<bug-id>.
#                      Default: DATA_DIR/fixr_clone.
# CC_FIXR_REPO_URL   — repo to clone. None => derive from `git remote get-url
#                      origin` of the running checkout at clone time.
# CC_FIXR_BASE_REF   — ref each per-dispatch worktree branches off (origin/master).
#
# LIVE-RUN PREREQUISITES (do NOT hardcode secrets here):
#   - add `github.com,api.github.com` to CC_SANDBOX_ALLOWED_DOMAINS so the
#     sandboxed run can fetch/push and reach the GitHub API, and
#   - provide a GitHub token via the `GH_TOKEN` env var (read straight through

# --- DP-314: the notes repo, linked into every cc-* workspace -----------------
# CLAUDE.md tells whoever reads it to navigate `memory/` (the Viking L0/L1/L2
# tree) and to WRITE decisions and root-cause findings back into it. That
# instruction was a lie for every cc-* instance: `memory/` is gitignored in this
# repo, so the deployed image — built in CI from a checkout — has never carried
# a copy, and a persona workspace is a bare directory with no CLAUDE.md either.
#
# ONE shared clone, symlinked in as `memory/` (option A). Concurrent dispatches
# can therefore race on `main`; accepted because memory writes are append-mostly
# to distinct files and two agents rarely run at once. The alternative — a notes
# worktree and branch per dispatch — adds a second PR to every run.
#
# Writable, deliberately: a read-only mount would make the memory protocol
# unfollowable. The link points OUT of the workspace, so the clone's real path is
# also added to the sandbox's `filesystem.allowWrite` (see src/utils/cc_sandbox.py)
# — without that the OS sandbox denies the write and the agent sees a bare EACCES.
#
# CC_NOTES_ENABLED  — master switch. Off => no link, no CLAUDE.md seeding.

# Proxmox management tools (DP-262). Bot-callable ops over SSH to the pve node:
# node/guest reboot + start/stop and swapping the active koboldcpp model on the
# GPU container's :5001. All destructive tools are is_write → parked for human
# confirmation. Default-off: with no reachable key/host the tools register but
# every call returns a clear error (they never crash startup).
#
# PVE_TOOLS_ENABLED — master switch. When false the ProxmoxIntegration still
#   registers (so the startup-wiring contract holds) but tool calls short-circuit
#   with a "disabled" error instead of attempting SSH.
# PVE_SSH_HOST / PVE_SSH_USER — the Proxmox node the tools drive (NOT a guest).
#   pct/qm/systemctl/reboot all run here; the node reaches its own guests.
# PVE_SSH_KEY — path (inside the derpr container) to the private key mounted
#   read-only from the host's ~/.ssh/pve_derpr. Register this ref in the vault so
#   the egress scrubber redacts it (DP-225). Blast radius should be bounded on
#   the pve side with a forced-command authorized_keys entry (fast-follow).
# PVE_SSH_TIMEOUT — seconds before an SSH op is abandoned (ConnectTimeout + hard
#   asyncio wait). Keeps a hung node from stalling the tool loop.
# PVE_MODEL_HOST_VMID — the container id whose systemd koboldcpp units bind :5001
#   (CT101 GPU box). list_models/gpu_status/set_active_model all run
#   `pct exec <vmid> -- ...` against it.
#
# ⚠️ There is deliberately NO unit map here (DP-332). There used to be —
# PVE_MODEL_UNITS, a JSON friendly-name → systemd-unit object — and it was config
# asserting what the box contains while the box was the actual authority. It
# drifted silently in both directions, and no test could catch either because
# every test injected its own map:
#   - a unit here that no longer existed  → list_models silently omitted it;
#   - a unit on the box that was NOT here → set_active_model never disabled it, so
#     it kept :5001 and `enable --now` on the target failed to bind.
# The second one is how the map was found stale (DP-329): the unit actually
# serving :5001 was unmapped, so list_models called every model inactive and no
# swap could ever succeed. Nothing errored. The units are now enumerated per call
# from `systemctl list-unit-files` on PVE_MODEL_HOST_VMID — see
# `ProxmoxToolHandler._discover_units`. Do not reintroduce a map, not even as an
# optional override: an override that is empty in production is a filter nobody
# tests, and it re-creates direction two.

# Node job completion callback (DP-343). The node's install and promote jobs are

# MODEL_JOB_WAKE_USER — the operator's Discord user id. Parks are keyed
#   (user_identifier, persona); a park raised under any other identifier is
#   invisible to the human's pending list and can never be approved. Empty =
#   wake skipped.
# MODEL_JOB_ALERT_CHANNEL_ID — Discord channel id the woken persona's reply is
