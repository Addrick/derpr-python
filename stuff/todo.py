# TODO: allow response to all messages matching bot name
# TODO: set flag/toggle for checking entire message or just first word for name call
# TODO: dynamic context: allow for 'wipe memory' command, need some kind of loop that tracks the beginning of convo

# TODO: start/stop system to sleep personas
# TODO: personal messages break due to lack of channel or guild name (both?)
# TODO: important: tokenizer request
# TODO: add temperature customizing commands
# TODO: better logging
