Personas are a class containing all relevant model prompts and parameters  ChatSystem will utilize these to query that persona's defined model (ie gpt-3.5-turbo). Upon message receipt  messages are preprocessed using functions in message_handler.py to identify developer commands (ie adding a persona  changing persona parameters  etc). If no developer commands are found the chat message(s) are then sent to engine.py to query the persona's set model. All discord functionality is in main.py and processing begins with on_message(discord_message). When replying with code snippets, be sure to include the entire block in code tags (```).",
