"""Read the numbers a KV-cache budget needs out of a gguf header (DP-265).

Deployed to the Proxmox node beside ``derpr-model-install``, which calls it after
a download verifies and folds the output into the job status. It exists so hypr
can *evaluate*

    KV_bytes_per_token = 2 · n_layer · n_kv_head · head_dim · bytes_per_elem

rather than only recite it. Without these numbers a context size is still picked
by hand with nothing to check it against.

⚠️ **``n_layer`` is the count of layers that actually cache K/V, which is NOT
``block_count`` on every architecture** (DP-344). Getting that wrong is worse
than having no number, because the formula's output is quoted to a human as
arithmetic. Two ways the header lies to a naive reader, both measured on models
this node serves:

- **Hybrid (Gated DeltaNet) archs** — ``qwen35``, ``qwen35moe`` — interleave
  attention blocks with SSM blocks that hold a *fixed* recurrent state and cache
  nothing per token. Qwen3.8-27B is 65 blocks of which **17** attend; using 65
  overstates the cache 3.8× and cost a live answer of "32k is the maximum
  context" for a model that fits 262144.
- **Per-layer attention shapes** — ``gemma4`` publishes
  ``attention.head_count_kv`` as a **list** (16 on sliding-window layers, 4 on
  full-attention ones) and a 1024-token ``attention.sliding_window``. There is no
  single ``n_kv_head``, and 50 of its 60 layers stop growing at the window, so a
  linear formula does not describe this model at any head count. Such a model is
  **refused** with a reason rather than estimated.
- **MTP draft blocks** carry a real ``attn_k`` and are still not cached, because
  koboldcpp only runs them under ``--usemtp`` (ROCm-only, and no unit here passes
  it). Qwen3.8-27B has 17 blocks with a K projection and kcpp allocates KV for
  **16**; block 64 is its ``nextn`` block.

So the layer count comes from the **tensor index** — the blocks carrying a K
projection, less the draft blocks — and not from a metadata integer that means
something else. Validated to the byte against koboldcpp's own
``llama_kv_cache: KV buffer size`` on two models: Qwen3.8-27B (16 layers,
34816 B/token at 262400 ctx) and Deckard-40B (24 layers, 52224 B/token at
16640 ctx).

Stdlib only, and it reads the header and the tensor index, never the tensor
*data* — a 30 GB file costs a few hundred KB of I/O here.

Output is a **JSON fragment**, not a document::

    ,"n_layer":48,"n_kv_head":8,"head_dim":128,"ssm_layers":0

or, when the model's cache cannot be described by the formula::

    ,"kv_shape_note":"per-layer attention.head_count_kv ...","ssm_layers":0

``ssm_layers`` is the count of blocks holding a recurrent state instead of a KV
cache, and it rides on both shapes because it answers a different question
(DP-360). Non-zero means hybrid, which is what decides whether
``--smartcachegrid`` can do anything for a unit; the same walk yields it, so it
costs nothing to report.

That shape is deliberate: the caller is a bash script on a node with no ``jq``,
and it appends this straight into the status object it is already printf-ing.
A file it cannot parse produces **no output and exit 0** — a header quirk must
never fail an install whose bytes verified.

#: it. Measured — Qwen3.8-27B has 17 blocks with `attn_k` and kcpp allocates KV
#: for 16 of them; block 64 is the nextn block.
#: ⚠️ If a unit here ever enables MTP, the draft block caches too and this
