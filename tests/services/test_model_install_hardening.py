"""DP-349 — the node installer's hardening, exercised as a script.

These are `bash` runs of `services/pve/derpr-model-install`, not Python unit
tests, because every defect here lives in shell: a byte cap standing in for an
element cap, a precheck separated from its commit, an unbounded `curl`, a
colliding destination name, and steps reported done off a discarded exit status.
None of it is reachable from derpr's side, and the node is deployed by hand —
so a test that mocks the script proves nothing about the file that ships.

DP-360 added a second reason to keep this file: the gguf-header gate lives in
shell too, and it silently discarded every refusal fragment for months while
four Python tests of the *producer* passed. A boundary with tests on only one
side of it is a boundary nothing tests.

The container is a shim directory on `PATH`. It answers the two probes the
installer now demands positive answers from, which is itself the point of
defect 6: a `pct exec` that fails is evidence about the *container*, never about
the unit, and reading it as "absent" disarms the guard exactly when the box
cannot be consulted.
