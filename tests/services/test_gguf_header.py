"""gguf header reader deployed to the pve node (DP-265).

The node-side installer folds this script's output into an install job's status.
DP-360 deleted the arithmetic that output used to feed, so these numbers are now
reported as facts about the file rather than consumed into a budget -- which
raises the stakes on reading them correctly rather than lowering them. A wrong
`n_layer` is no longer one term of an estimate a human might sanity-check; it is
a measurement, quoted as one.

These tests build gguf headers byte by byte, because the whole risk here is
