# tests/integration/test_node_transport_gate.py
#
# DP-348 — the pve node has exactly ONE door, and both handlers go through it.
#
# `PVE_TOOLS_ENABLED` and the SSH in-flight cap are properties of the key and of
# the node's sshd, not of any one handler. They used to live inside
# `ProxmoxToolHandler._run`; when the HuggingFace tools grew their own copy of
# that method (DP-265) they inherited neither, so `install_model` shelled out to
# the box while every proxmox tool correctly reported itself disabled, and HF
# connections were invisible to the cap that keeps the node under sshd's
# MaxStartups (10:30:100).
#
# Nothing in the unit suites could see it: each handler's tests asserted that
# handler's `_run` behaved the way that handler's tests expected. This file
# asserts the *seam* instead — the same question asked of every handler that
# reaches the node — in the spirit of test_startup_wiring.py, which asserts a
# registration contract no single component's own tests can see either.
