"""Hot/cold gguf tiering (DP-340).

The behaviour under test exists because of a real outage: on 2026-08-21 a 22 GB
model download filled the node's thin pool and put CT100 *and* CT101 into ext4
`emergency_ro`, taking zammad, the chatbot and hindsight's database down
together. Downloads now land on the archive disk and only reach the SSD via an
explicit promotion.

Two properties matter more than the happy path and are asserted directly:

1. **A node without the tier script must keep working.** The node artifacts in
   `services/pve/` and the container image are two independent deploys, so this
   code will meet nodes that have never heard of `derpr-model-tier`.
2. **Promoting must not disturb :5001.** A promotion is minutes long; if it
   disabled the running model first, every cold selection would take the
   service down for the length of a copy.
