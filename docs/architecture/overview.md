Async, provider-agnostic LLM orchestration engine for chatbot automation (IT support, ticketing, conversational AI). Python 3.14, async throughout.

**Pipeline:** Interface -> ChatSystem (DI hub) -> BotLogic (commands) -> TextEngine (LLM) -> ToolManager (tool loop, budget `MAX_TOOL_CALLS`=15 tool calls **executed** + runaway guard `MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS`=25 round trips — DP-335 split the two, because one iteration cap meant a different amount of work per provider) -> MemoryManager (SQLite, transcript layer) -> MemoryBackend (semantic + episodic; default `SqliteSemanticBackend`; `HindsightBackend` shipped and merged to master, selectable via `SEMANTIC_BACKEND=hindsight`). Engine-side retrieval/consolidation now flows through `MemoryBackend.recall` / `retain_turn` (DP-113); transcript layer (log_message, suppression, audit) still goes via MemoryManager. Cross-persona fan-out recall available via `src/memory/router.py` `MemoryRouter` (Sprint 4 groundwork; no production caller yet — wired in Sprint 5 metabank). Per-turn scope (persona/channel/user/server) is pinned in `src/tools/turn_context.py` so engine-side tools can inherit context without it appearing as model-callable args.

**Interfaces:** Discord bot (primary, interactive), Gmail bot (polling, no persistence), ZammadBot (agent-based polling), KoboldEngineAdapter (FastAPI on :5003; React/Vite/TS portal at `/derpr` (DP-132–137) — the Kobold Lite portal at `/portal` and its kobold-native generation routes were retired in DP-365; OAI route `/v1/chat/completions` is a thin SSE transcoder over `chat_system.stream_response` (Phase D, 2026-04-28); persona CRUD incl. `POST /api/v1/personas` create (DP-231), version-chevron + transcript API)

**Providers:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Google (Gemini 2.5/3.1, Gemma), local kobold-native (StreamEngine, DP-206b), Antigravity (`agy` CLI, DP-127), Claude Code (`cc-*` sandboxed CLI, DP-222 — runs its OWN sandboxed tool loop, DERPR's `tools` arg ignored). Rate limiters split by model family. DP-244 refactored the engine from the `src/engine.py` monolith into the `src/engine/` package — slimmed `TextEngine` in `driver.py`, a `Provider` ABC family in `providers/`, and an ordered `ProviderRegistry` (`registry.py`) that routes via `resolve(model_name)` (public imports unchanged).

**Persona system:** Stateful LLM config objects with ExecutionMode (AUTONOMOUS, CONFIRM) and MemoryMode (CHANNEL_ISOLATED, SERVER_WIDE, PERSONAL, GLOBAL, TICKET_ISOLATED). Note: execution mode still affects UI presentation, but **all write tools park for audit** regardless of mode per the security framework. Runtime-mutable via `set` commands. System personas are read-only configs used by agents for analysis. DP-255 adds per-persona Hindsight bank fields: `retain_mission` / `reflect_mission` (honoured at bank creation) and `disposition` (`{skepticism|literalism|empathy}`, each clamped 1–5).

**Agent framework:** Agent ABC (src/agents/base.py) → AgentManager lifecycle → AppManager top-level coordinator. Currently: ZammadBot (multi-stage triage via 4 system personas), DispatchAgent (priority assessment + config-driven notification), ReminderAgent (scheduled open-ticket nudges — shipped), ManagrAgent (autonomous ticket-triage manager; emits human-approved writes into the `src/proposals/` queue rather than writing directly), and SqliteConsolidator (SQLite memory consolidation, registered only when `SEMANTIC_BACKEND=sqlite`). Autonomous background workers on interval schedules. Config-driven via agents.json. Agents invoke system personas for read-only LLM analysis; do not spawn other agents. Agent tools (status/history/manage) gated behind service_bindings.

**fixr self-improvement supervisor (DP-227):** `src/self_edit/` — event-driven dispatcher above the engine. `dispatch_fix` (WRITE→parked) spawns a detached `claude` coding-agent subprocess per bug in an isolated git worktree; a bridge tails its stream-json log and wakes the `fixr` persona on question/done/error. `FixrIntegration` (ServiceIntegration, `service_bindings:["fixr"]`) registered at startup. Never merges/pushes — a human merges the PR.

**Security (DP-225):** `src/security/` — `CredentialVault` inventories machine secrets (OpenAI/Anthropic/Google/Zammad keys); `SecretScrubber` redacts them from any string bound for the LLM context / audit / inspector. Wired at startup via `bootstrap.register_credentials()` (vault→scrubber), enforced at egress in tool_loop, turn_persistence, engine, zammad_client.

**Notification system:** NotificationRouter → Notifier ABC (DiscordNotifier, DiscordChannelNotifier, ZammadNotifier, LogNotifier; voice registers a `web` channel via WebAlarmNotifier). Decoupled from agents — channel/recipient config-driven.

**Write gating (DP-297 / DP-319):** every write tool parks for human approval, mid-turn rather than as a turn-ending exit. `ConfirmationManager` (`src/confirmations.py`) is keyed by **token**, so one turn can queue N proposals resolvable independently and out of order, and it is **durable** — parks survive a restart via the `Parked_Writes` table, with a boot reconciliation that expires stale rows, terminates in-flight ones as `interrupted_by_restart` (**never re-executed**), and quarantines unreadable ones. Distinct from `src/proposals/` (the autonomous-agent queue), whose only remaining separation is `ProposalExecutor`'s `action_type` whitelist.

**Voice (DP-238):** `src/voice/` — browser/phone push-to-talk → Moonshine STT (CPU) → the *text* LLM, which owns timers via `set_timer`/`list_timers`/`cancel_timer` tools. Routes mount onto the engine-adapter app (`VOICE_WEB_ENABLED`, default off). Discord voice-receive is dead (DAVE E2EE).

**MCP bridge (DP-240):** `src/tools/mcp_bridge.py` — the *server* mirror of the MCP client: derpr hosts an MCP server so a capable fixr subagent can call derpr tools over HTTP. Per-dispatch bearer token, default-deny tool allow-list, and gated calls become `call_derpr_tool` proposal rows rather than executing. This module is the only authz boundary for capable dispatches.

**Tool system:** JSON schemas in definitions.py, read-only vs write (all write tools go through human confirmation — parked for audit regardless of execution mode), service-binding filtered. ServiceIntegration ABC is a tool-registration-only interface (lifecycle hooks removed 2026-03-28). Agent tools registered via AgentServiceIntegration. DP-263 adds an optional `exfil_capable` capability (default True): a network tool sets it False to opt out of the exfil-composition policy (`tool_policy.py` Rules 2/3) when its egress carries no model-controlled payload.

**Proxmox management (DP-262):** `src/proxmox/` — `ProxmoxIntegration` (ServiceIntegration, `service_bindings:["proxmox"]`, always registered) exposes 8 SSH-driven tools (`PROXMOX_TOOLS`): reads `pve_status`/`list_models`/`gpu_status`, writes (parked) `reboot_node`/`reboot_guest`/`start_guest`/`stop_guest`/`set_active_model`. DP-264 model-availability guard hides/refuses units whose gguf isn't on disk. DP-332 made the model list and the GPU's VRAM **discovered** (systemd units + sysfs read per call) rather than asserted in config.

**MCP client (DP-268):** `src/tools/mcp_client.py` + `mcp_integration.py` — consume external MCP tool servers (streamable-HTTP); `MCPClientManager` (main.py-owned) + `MCPIntegration` (ServiceIntegration `"mcp"`, always registered) exposes `add`/`remove`/`list_mcp_servers`, discovering each server's tools into the live `ToolDefinitionRegistry` as `mcp__<server>__<tool>` with restrictive default security metadata.

**Storage:** SQLite — User_Interactions (conversations), Suppressed_Interactions, Interaction_Edit_History + Edit_History_Embeddings (version chevrons), Message_Embeddings + Memory_Segments + Memory_Summaries (+ `vec_` sqlite-vec shadows), Agent_Actions + Agent_Action_Contexts, Audit_Log, Proposals (DP-282), Standing_Orders (DP-281), Parked_Writes (DP-319). All async via to_thread().

**Config:** global_config.py (limits, rate limits), default_personas.json + system_personas.json (git-tracked), data/personas.json (local override), agents.json.

**Testing:** 4-tier (unit, integration, zammad-live, llm-live). No pre-commit test hook — tests run manually. Migration tests via legacy_mem_manager fixture.

**Docs:** `docs/user_guide.md` — user-facing behavior spec (commands, personas, tools, interfaces). Also serves as spec-before-implement target for new features.

**Dead code:** none known (the deprecated `interfaces/zammad_bot.py` stub was removed by DP-203).
